A collection of diagrams visualizing Thomas Aquinas's philosophical anthropology (ST I.75-85), with applications to understanding AI capabilities and limitations.

## Charts

### [Cognitive Architecture](charts/03-cognitive-architecture.mmd)
The complete structure: external senses → internal senses → intellect

### [Process of Cognition](charts/05-cognition-process.mmd)
Step-by-step: How "I see an apple" becomes "I can reason about apples"

### [The Stellatum Boundary](charts/09-stellatum-boundary.mmd)
Where LLMs operate (internal senses) vs. what they cannot reach (intellect)

## Applications

- **For AI Researchers:** Framework for understanding LLM capabilities/limitations
- **For Philosophy Students:** Visual learning aid for Thomistic psychology
- **For Classical Educators:** Teaching tool for anthropology/formation
- **For Anyone:** Understanding what makes human intelligence unique

## Key Insight

Large Language Models operate at the level of Aquinas's "internal senses" (phantasmic operations, pattern recognition, associative memory) but cannot cross the ontological boundary into intellectual operations (abstracting universals, grasping necessity, syllogistic reasoning).
